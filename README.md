## Description

This is the implementation of Shizhan Zhu et al.'s ICLR-22 work [Differentiable Gradient Sampling for Learning Implicit 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://zhusz.github.io/ICLR22-DGS-Webpage/pdf/iclr22-dgs.pdf).
It is open source under the MIT license (see the `LICENSE` file). Codes can be used freely for any ethical purpose.

DGS is among the first attempts to tackle the generalizable 3D
implicit surface reconstruction from a single image for indoor scenes,
via directly learning from raw scan data.
